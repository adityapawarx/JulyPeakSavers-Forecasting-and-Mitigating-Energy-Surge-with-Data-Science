# JulyPeakSavers-Forecasting-and-Mitigating-Energy-Surge-with-Data-Science

## Description

This project, undertaken by Team 02 for the IST687 - Introduction to Data Science course, aims to address the challenges of peak energy demand during the hot month of July. By analyzing energy consumption data, weather conditions, and housing characteristics, our team developed predictive models to forecast hourly energy usage. The insights gained are crucial for devising strategies to manage and reduce peak energy demand sustainably.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- R programming language
- Shiny application for interactive data visualization
- Various R packages (e.g., `tidyverse`, `shiny`, `leaflet`, `xgboost`, `caret`)

### Installation

No installation is necessary to view the Shiny application, which can be accessed at [CoolCurrents Shiny App](https://soundaryaravir.shinyapps.io/eSCApp).

### Data Analysis

The project involves comprehensive data processing, including cleaning, merging, and transforming energy consumption, weather, and static house data. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed significant patterns, which informed the development of predictive models using techniques such as Linear Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.

### Key Features of the Shiny Application

- Interactive dashboards visualizing energy consumption patterns
- Predictive models' performance comparison
- Future energy demand forecasting under different scenarios

## Contributing

This project was developed as part of a coursework assignment and is not open for public contribution. However, feedback and suggestions are welcome to improve the analysis and the application.
